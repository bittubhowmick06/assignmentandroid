# Android Assignment
Create an application with following specifications
1. A Splash screen with white background and desired image in centre
2. After 5 secs , from splash screen user has to be navigated to a page which has a 
list
3. In List page, each row will have a image, Title and description
4. Each row should be the right height to display its own content and no taller. No 
content should be clipped. This means some rows will be larger than others.
5. Don't download all images at once, only as needed.
6. Refresh function, either a refresh button or use pull down to refresh.
7. On click of each cell, display a dialog which shows the description.
8. You can use a third-party Json parser to parse this if desired.
9. Use MVVM Architecture
Guidelines
1. Use Git to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is 
required.
2. Structure your code according to industry best practice design patterns.
3. Scrolling the list should be smooth, even as images are downloading and getting 
added to the cells.
4. Comment your code when necessary.
5. Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments.
